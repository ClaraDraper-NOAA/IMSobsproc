Code for processing IMS input ascii files on the UFS model grid. 

Inputs: IMS ascci file, IMS index file (generated offline), and UFS vegetaton type file
        IMS index file and vegetation type file both model resolution specific.

Output: file with i) IMS-derived snow cover fraction over land on UFS model grid, and ii) SWE derived form the IMS snow cover fraction, using an inversion of the noah model snow depletion curve.
        

To compile: 
./build.sh
